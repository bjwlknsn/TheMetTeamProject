# TheMetTeamProject
The Metropolitan Museum of Art provides select datasets of information on more than 470,000 artworks in its collection for unrestricted commercial and noncommercial use. The datasets are available in CSV format, encoded in UTF-8. This exploration used a CSV which we cleaned to remove blanks in country and then narrowed to countries with 20 or more objects for analysis.

Analysis conducted in jupyter notebook with pandas, matplotlib, and Google maps. Select findings are presented in a PowerPoint.

Project done by TJ Ossola and Bryce Wilkinson
